I am currently a Senior Research Engineer in the Highly Automated Driving (HAD) team at [HERE Technologies](https://here.com/) Automotive Division in Chicago, IL. 

Previously, I graduated with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ in the summer of 2016. During my Ph.D. studies, I worked in areas such as Machine Learning (including Deep Learning, CNNs), multimedia signal processing and Computer Vision. 

Prior to attending Stevens, I received my Bachelor of Engineering from University of Science and Technology of China and my Master of Science from University of Florida. 

As a passionate engineer and researcher, I appreciate the opportunities to build a network with innovative individuals who share the interests in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision.
